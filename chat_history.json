I rephrased it to \"what are the legal provisions under Pakistani law\" to make it more formal and specific.\n* \"people who sell fruits on high rate\" is vague.

The improved question takes into account the relevant Pakistani laws and regulations.\n\n**Proper Structure:**\n\nThe improved question follows a logical structure:\n\n1. **Specific context**: What are the legal provisions under Pakistani law...\n2. **Specific issue**: ...regarding price gouging or profiteering by fruit sellers...\n3. **Specific query**: ...and what are the consequences for selling fruits at inflated rates?\n\nThe improved question is now clear, specific, and properly structured, making it easier to provide an accurate and relevant response."
